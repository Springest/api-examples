# Example code for the Springest API
This is some example code for using our [API][api]. It's not a real SDK, but it can help you with some basic tasks for getting data out of our API. We've written examples in Ruby and PHP, because these are the languages we use the most, but these examples should be easily converted to your own preferred language.

If you got any questions about these examples, send us an [e-mail][mail].
